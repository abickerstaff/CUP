## CUP

Project for QCC CSC 212. This project monitors specific files that are user determined to help prevent against cyber attacks. The initial version will be designed for Linux servers, but will be expanded to other OS's. It helps protect files by sending notifications to assigned contacts when changes have been made to the protected files.
